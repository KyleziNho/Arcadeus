🔍 DEBUG IMPROVEMENTS: Enhanced logging and duplicate prevention

🛠️ Duplicate Initialization Fix:
- Added singleton pattern for MAModelingAddin instantiation
- Prevents multiple instances causing duplicate event listeners
- Guards against race conditions during initialization
- Eliminates 'Chat messages div not found' console errors

📊 Enhanced Auto-Fill Debugging:
- Added detailed logging for file contents sent to AI
- Log exact AI prompt being generated
- Log complete request payload to /.netlify/functions/chat
- Enhanced visibility into AI response processing
- Step-by-step process tracking with console logs

🐛 Console Error Resolution:
- Fixed duplicate addChatMessage calls at initialization
- Singleton pattern prevents multiple MAModelingAddin instances
- Clean console output during auto-fill process
- Better error tracking and debugging capabilities

💡 Debug Information Added:
- File contents extraction logging
- AI prompt structure verification
- Request payload inspection
- Response data analysis
- Processing step tracking

🧪 Testing Protocol:
1. Open browser console before testing
2. Upload CSV file and click 'Auto Fill with AI'
3. Monitor console for detailed processing logs:
   - 'DEBUG - File contents being sent to AI'
   - 'DEBUG - AI prompt'
   - 'DEBUG - Request payload'
   - AI response status and data
4. Identify exactly where the process fails

This commit adds comprehensive debugging to identify why the AI
auto-fill shows 'Limited data extracted' despite valid CSV files
containing complete financial data.
