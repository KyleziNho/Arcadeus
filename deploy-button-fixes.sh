ðŸ”§ Button Functionality Fixes:
- Fixed JavaScript syntax errors causing buttons to not work
- Corrected indentation issues in initializeDebtModel function
- Removed orphaned else clause that was breaking initialization
- Restored proper event listener setup for all interactive elements

ðŸ§¹ UI Cleanup - Remove Select Range Section:
- Removed 'Select Range for Assumptions' button from Deal Assumptions
- Removed 'Click to select Excel range with your assumptions' status text
- Cleaned up associated JavaScript event listeners
- Streamlined Deal Assumptions section for cleaner interface

âš¡ Technical Fixes:
- Fixed debt model initialization function structure
- Ensured proper event listener attachment for collapsible sections
- Maintained all existing debt calculation and Excel generation functionality
- Corrected function scope and indentation throughout debt model logic

ðŸŽ¯ Restored Functionality:
- Collapsible section minimize/expand buttons working
- Generate Debt Schedule button functional
- Rate type toggles and input field listeners active
- Chat interface and file upload buttons operational

This resolves the button functionality issues while cleaning up
the interface for a more streamlined user experience.
