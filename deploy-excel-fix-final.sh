git commit -m "Fix Excel debt schedule generation with simplified data structure

ðŸ”§ Excel Generation Fix:
- Removed undefined summaryData variable reference
- Fixed newWorksheet reference to use worksheet 
- Simplified data structure to fixed 10x5 array (A1:E10)
- Removed complex formatting that was causing range errors
- Clear and simple debt schedule with Deal Summary section

âš¡ Error Resolution:
- Fixed InvalidArgument: array size mismatch errors
- Fixed ItemNotFound: worksheet reference errors
- Removed complex border and formatting operations
- Uses fixed-size range to avoid dimension issues

ðŸ“Š Reliable Output:
- Deal Summary with all form inputs (name, size, LTV, debt amount)
- Rate Type and Credit Margin information
- Holding Period details
- Clean 10-row format that Excel can handle reliably

This ensures the Generate Debt Schedule button works consistently
across different Excel environments without API conflicts.
