# Stage both HTML and JavaScript files with collapsible functionality
git add taskpane.html
git add taskpane.js

# Commit the complete collapsible feature
git commit -m "Complete collapsible Deal Assumptions section implementation

âœ¨ HTML Structure Changes:
- Added 'collapsible-section' class to Deal Assumptions section
- Added section-header div with minimize button
- Added section-content wrapper for collapsible content
- Added minimize button with chevron SVG icon
- Added proper IDs for JavaScript targeting

âœ¨ JavaScript Functionality:
- Added initializeCollapsibleSections() method to MAModelingAddin class
- Added event listener for minimize button to toggle 'collapsed' class
- Added accessibility support with dynamic aria-label updates
- Added console logging for debugging and verification

âœ¨ CSS Animations (already implemented):
- Smooth max-height transitions (400ms) with cubic-bezier easing
- Opacity fade effects (300ms) synchronized with height changes
- Icon rotation animation (180Â°) when collapsed/expanded
- Reduced padding when collapsed for cleaner appearance

ðŸŽ¯ Functionality:
- Click minimize button in Deal Assumptions header to collapse/expand
- Smooth animations provide professional user experience
- AI chat remains fully visible when assumptions are minimized
- Accessible design with proper ARIA labels

This resolves the 'Could not find collapsible section elements' error
by ensuring both HTML structure and JavaScript functionality are deployed.
