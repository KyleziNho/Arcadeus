ðŸŽ¯ SIMPLIFIED APPROACH: Focus on High-Level Parameters Only

ðŸ“Š Extraction Scope Reduced:
- ONLY extracts: currency, project start date, project end date, model periods
- Removed complex sections: deal assumptions, revenue items, cost items, exit assumptions, debt model
- Simplified AI prompt with clear, focused instructions
- Reduced token usage and processing complexity

ðŸ”§ AI Prompt Improvements:
- Clear task definition: 'Extract HIGH-LEVEL PARAMETERS ONLY'
- Specific extraction rules for each parameter
- Example format showing exact JSON structure expected
- Currency detection from symbols and codes
- Date calculation from holding period (60 months in CSV)

ðŸ“… Date Processing Logic:
- Project Start: Extract 'Acquisition date,31/03/2025' â†’ '2025-03-31'
- Project End: Start date + holding period (60 months) = '2030-03-31'
- Model Periods: Default to 'monthly' for financial modeling
- Automatic holding period calculation between dates

ðŸ’± Currency Detection:
- Detect from document context: 'Currency,USD'
- Support all major currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, CHF, CNY, SEK, NOK
- Extract from monetary values and currency symbols

ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results from Your CSV:
- Currency: USD (from 'Currency,USD' line)
- Start Date: 2025-03-31 (from 'Acquisition date,31/03/2025')
- End Date: 2030-03-31 (calculated from 60 month holding period)
- Model Periods: monthly (default for financial models)

âœ¨ Enhanced Logging:
- Detailed console output for each parameter extraction
- Step-by-step application logging
- Clear success/failure messages
- Focused debugging for high-level parameters only

ðŸ§ª Testing Protocol:
1. Upload your 'Sample Company Ltd.' CSV
2. Click 'Auto Fill with AI'
3. Check console for detailed extraction logs
4. Verify high-level parameters section populates
5. Confirm holding periods calculate automatically

This simplified approach should successfully extract and populate
the high-level parameters from your CSV file, providing a solid
foundation before expanding to other sections.
