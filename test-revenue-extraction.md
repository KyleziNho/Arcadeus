# Revenue Items Extraction Test Guide

## What I've Implemented

The system now has enhanced AI-powered revenue extraction that:

1. **Searches for exact revenue items** in uploaded files
2. **Extracts specific data** for each revenue item:
   - Name (exact from document)
   - Initial value (numeric)
   - Growth type (linear/nonlinear/no_growth)
   - Growth rate (percentage for linear growth)
3. **Creates the exact number** of revenue items found in files
4. **Matches growth rates** to specific revenue items

## Example Inputs and Expected Outputs

### Example 1: CSV with explicit revenue items
```csv
Revenue Item 1,500000
Revenue Item 2,766000
Rent Growth 1,2%
Rent Growth 2,3%
```
**Expected Output:**
- Revenue Item 1: $500,000 (linear 2%)
- Revenue Item 2: $766,000 (linear 3%)

### Example 2: Financial statement format
```
Rental Income: $1,200,000 (growing at 3% annually)
Service Revenue: $450,000 (flat)
Licensing Fees: $230,000 (5% CAGR)
```
**Expected Output:**
- Rental Income: $1,200,000 (linear 3%)
- Service Revenue: $450,000 (no_growth)
- Licensing Fees: $230,000 (linear 5%)

### Example 3: Image/Screenshot
If uploading a screenshot showing:
```
Revenue Streams:
- Product A: $2.5M
- Product B: $1.8M
- Product C: $900K
Growth assumption: 4% across all products
```
**Expected Output:**
- Product A: $2,500,000 (linear 4%)
- Product B: $1,800,000 (linear 4%)
- Product C: $900,000 (linear 4%)
