- Consistent form styling with other sections

🔧 JavaScript Functionality:
- Complete initializeExitAssumptions() function implementation

- Event listeners for input changes
- Console logging for debugging and monitoring
- Typical range validation (disposal: 0-10%, cap rate: 0-20%)

🖱️ Full Collapsible Integration:
- Minimize/expand button with smooth animations
- Click-to-expand functionality for collapsed sections
- Proper aria-label updates for accessibility
- Icon transitions (+/−) for visual feedback
- Integrated into main collapsible sections system

⚡ Enhanced User Experience:

🧮 Financial Modeling Integration:
- Key exit assumptions for M&A/PE modeling
- Industry-standard disposal cost and cap rate inputs
- Ready for Excel generation and calculations

- Essential for IRR and exit value calculations

📈 Exit Value Calculation Ready:
- Disposal Cost: Reduces net proceeds at exit
- Terminal Cap Rate: Used for NOI capitalization approach
- Both parameters essential for exit valuation
- Professional modeling standards compliance

This creates a focused, professional exit assumptions section
that captures the essential parameters needed for M&A/PE
exit modeling and valuation calculations.
