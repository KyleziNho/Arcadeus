git commit -m "Add comprehensive Cost Items section mirroring Revenue Items functionality

üí∏ Cost Items Management (identical to Revenue Items):
- New collapsible section with professional card-based layout
- One required cost item (cannot be removed)
- Add/remove additional cost items with dynamic functionality
- Clean card design with headers and remove buttons for optional items

üí∞ Cost Item Configuration:
- Cost Item Name: Text input for cost category identification
- Initial Value: Numeric input for starting cost amount
- Currency integration with High-Level Parameters selection
- Professional help text for user guidance

üéØ Flexible Growth Types (identical to Revenue):
1. No Growth: Costs remain constant over time
2. Linear Growth: Single annual growth rate (positive or negative)
3. Non-Linear Growth: Period-by-period specific growth rates

üìä Smart Non-Linear Growth (period-linked):
- Automatically uses project start/end dates from High-Level Parameters
- Generates period-specific input fields based on project timeline
- ‚â§12 periods: Individual period-by-period growth input fields
- >12 periods: Grouped period ranges with add/remove functionality
- Smart suggestions for period ranges (e.g., Months 1-12, then 13-24)
- Automatic period calculations from High-Level Parameters

üé® Professional UI Design (consistent with Revenue Items):
- Card-based layout with bordered containers
- Grid layout for optimal space utilization
- Red remove buttons with hover effects
- Organized input groupings with clear labeling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

üîß Technical Features:
- Complete JavaScript implementation with initializeCostItems()
- setupCostItemListeners() and updateCostGrowthInputs() functions
- addCostPeriodGroup() for advanced period grouping functionality
- Dynamic DOM manipulation for add/remove functionality
- Event delegation for scalable event handling
- Unique ID system for multiple cost items
- Real-time growth input updates based on type selection
- Integration with project timeline from High-Level Parameters

‚ö° User Experience:
- Intuitive add/remove workflow
- Clear visual distinction between required and optional items
- Contextual help text for each input type (cost-specific)
- Smooth transitions and professional animations
- Consistent styling with other sections
- Click-to-expand functionality for collapsed sections

üñ±Ô∏è Enhanced Collapsible Functionality:
- Cost Items section fully integrated into collapsible system
- Click anywhere on collapsed section to expand it
- Prevents expansion when clicking minimize button
- Smooth cursor change indicators (pointer for collapsed, default for expanded)
- Professional minimize/expand icon transitions

üßÆ Cost Modeling Features:
- Structured data collection for Excel generation
- Support for complex cost growth scenarios
- Period-by-period granular control for detailed planning
- Both linear and non-linear modeling capabilities
- Professional cost escalation modeling

üìà Period-Linked Non-Linear Cost Growth:
- Links non-linear growth to High-Level Parameters period selection
- Uses actual calculated holding periods from project dates
- Adapts to selected period type (daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Dynamic period labeling based on user selection
- Group 1: Default periods 1-12 with customizable growth rate
- Add Group: Creates new range starting from last period + 1
- Remove Groups: Dynamic group management with smart re-indexing
- Example: Months 1-12 at 3% cost increase, Months 13-36 at 2%

This creates a comprehensive cost modeling system that perfectly
mirrors the Revenue Items functionality and provides professional-grade
flexibility for sophisticated financial planning and analysis.
