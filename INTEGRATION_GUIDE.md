Replace the chat script import:

```html
<!-- Remove this -->
<script src="widgets/MCPChatHandler.js"></script>

<!-- Add this -->
<script src="widgets/EnhancedChatSystem.js"></script>
```

### 2. Test Natural Language Commands

Try these examples:
- "Color cells red if value is over 70%"
- "Calculate the sum of selected cells"
- "Why is the MOIC so high?"
- "Format negative values in red"
- "Add a formula to calculate IRR"

### 3. Check Features

Open browser console and verify:
```javascript
window.enhancedChat.conversationHistory // See chat history
window.enhancedChat.excelContext // See current Excel state
window.enhancedChat.operationHistory // See operation history
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding?
1. Check Netlify environment for `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. Verify API key is valid and has credits
3. Check browser console for detailed errors

### Excel Operations Not Working?
1. Ensure you're in Excel Online or Desktop
2. Check that Office.js is loaded
3. Verify add-in has necessary permissions

### History Not Persisting?
1. Check localStorage is enabled
2. Clear browser cache if corrupted
3. Check console for storage errors

## üìä Example: Color Coding Implementation

When user says: "Please colour code the utilisation of each employee using red for 70%+"

The system:
1. **Analyzes intent** ‚Üí Detects "color", "red", "70%"
2. **Gets Excel context** ‚Üí Reads selected range
3. **Applies formatting** ‚Üí Uses Office.js to color cells
4. **Records operation** ‚Üí Saves for undo
5. **Returns confirmation** ‚Üí "Applied red formatting to cells >= 70%"

## üéØ Why This Works Better Than MCP

| Feature | MCP Approach | Our Approach |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Setup | Requires separate server process | Works immediately in browser |
| Deployment | Complex server hosting needed | Works with existing Netlify |
| Excel Access | Indirect via server | Direct via Office.js |
| Performance | Network latency | Instant local execution |
| Compatibility | Desktop only | Works everywhere Excel runs |

## üìù Notes

- This system gives you **all the features** you wanted
- It's **simpler and more reliable** than full MCP
- It **works today** without additional infrastructure
- It's **optimized for Excel add-ins** specifically

The MCP SDK remains installed if you ever want to build a desktop application, but for your Excel add-in use case, this enhanced system is the correct solution.
