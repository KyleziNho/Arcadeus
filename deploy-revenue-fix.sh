🔧 REVENUE EXTRACTION FIX: Mandatory revenue item creation

❌ Problem Fixed:
- AI was not extracting revenue items from CSV data
- Success summary showed no revenue items section
- Revenue Items section remained empty after auto-fill

✅ Enhanced Revenue Logic:
- MANDATORY requirement: Always return at least one revenue item
- Multi-tier extraction strategy: explicit → implied → default
- Business model-based revenue stream creation
- Estimated revenue values from deal context

🎯 Improved Extraction Strategy:
1. EXPLICIT REVENUE: Search for stated revenue figures
2. IMPLIED REVENUE: Use deal value + business model for estimates  
3. DEFAULT REVENUE: Always create meaningful revenue streams

💡 Business Context Intelligence:
- Technology + SaaS → 'Subscription Revenue'
- Business model drives revenue stream naming
- Deal value provides scale for revenue estimates
- Fallback to 'Primary Revenue Stream' if generic

🧪 Enhanced Debugging:
- Detailed console logging for revenue item extraction
- Full extracted data structure visibility
- Array validation and existence checks
- Step-by-step revenue application tracking

📊 Expected Results from Sample Company Ltd CSV:
- Business Model: SaaS Technology company
- Should extract: 'Subscription Revenue' or 'Technology Revenue'
- Estimated value based on $100M deal value context
- Default to linear growth pattern

🔍 Debugging Console Output:
- 'Found revenue items in extracted data: [...]'
- 'Number of revenue items to apply: X'
- Or warning messages showing exactly what's missing

This ensures revenue items section will always populate
with contextually appropriate revenue streams.
