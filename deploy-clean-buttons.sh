ðŸ§¹ Complete Clean Design:
- Hidden all radio button circles (selected and unselected)
- Hidden all checkbox squares (selected and unselected)
- Text-only button design for maximum cleanliness
- Removed unnecessary hover styles for hidden elements

âœ¨ Visual Result:
- Unselected buttons: Clean text on light background
- Selected buttons: White text on blue background
- No circles, squares, or visual indicators anywhere
- Pure text-based interface design

ðŸŽ¨ Modern Minimalist Approach:
- Follows modern web design trends
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Focus on content rather than decorative elements
- Professional, enterprise-grade appearance

ðŸ”§ Technical Cleanup:
- Set display: none on all .radio-custom elements
- Set display: none on all .checkbox-custom elements
- Removed obsolete hover styles for hidden elements
- Maintained button hover and selection animations

The interface now has a completely clean, text-only
button design with no visual indicators whatsoever.
