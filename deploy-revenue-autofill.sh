ðŸ“ˆ REVENUE ITEMS EXTRACTION: Add dynamic revenue stream identification and processing

ðŸŽ¯ New Revenue Processing Capabilities:
- Identify all revenue streams from uploaded documents
- Extract revenue names, initial values, and growth patterns
- Dynamically create matching number of revenue items in UI
- Determine growth types: linear, no_growth, or nonlinear
- Apply growth rates for linear growth scenarios

ðŸ’° Revenue Data Intelligence:
- Search for 'Revenue', 'Sales', 'Income', 'Turnover' in documents
- Extract specific revenue categories and product lines
- Process current/base year revenue amounts
- Analyze growth patterns and rates from financial projections
- Handle multiple revenue streams with different growth characteristics

ðŸ”§ Dynamic UI Management:
- Clear existing revenue items before applying new data
- Create additional revenue items based on extracted count
- Use existing applyRevenueItems function for proper field mapping
- Set revenue names, initial values, growth types, and rates
- Maintain proper revenue item IDs and counters

ðŸ“‹ Growth Type Classification:
- LINEAR: Consistent growth rate (e.g., 5% annually)
- NO_GROWTH: Flat/stable revenue (0% growth)  
- NONLINEAR: Varying growth rates over time periods

ðŸ§  Enhanced AI Extraction Logic:
- Comprehensive revenue stream identification
- Business type-based revenue categorization
- Growth pattern analysis from historical/projected data
- Smart naming conventions for revenue streams
- Conversion of percentages and monetary values

âœ¨ Complete Auto-Fill Flow:
HIGH-LEVEL PARAMETERS:
- Currency, dates, model periods

DEAL ASSUMPTIONS:  
- Deal name, value, transaction fees, LTV

REVENUE ITEMS (NEW):
- Dynamic revenue stream creation
- Growth type and rate application
- Multiple revenue categories support

ðŸ§ª Expected Results from Financial Documents:
- All revenue streams identified and created as separate items
- Proper growth classification based on document analysis
- Revenue values extracted and formatted correctly
- Growth rates applied to linear growth scenarios
- Complete revenue section population from single file upload

This completes the core financial data extraction covering all
primary deal parameters and revenue modeling requirements.
