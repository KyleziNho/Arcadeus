## 🚀 How It Works

### User Experience Flow
1. **User asks analytical question** → "Why is my IRR lower than expected?"
2. **Query analysis** → System detects this is financial analysis
3. **Chain-of-thought processing** → AI walks through step-by-step
4. **Progressive UI updates** → Each step appears as it's analyzed
5. **Interactive results** → Clickable references, recommendations, next steps

### Technical Flow
```
User Input → Enhanced Streaming Chat → Netlify Function → OpenAI API
                ↓
Excel Context ← ExcelLiveAnalyzer ← Excel API
                ↓
Structured Response → Progressive UI → Interactive Elements
```

## 🎯 Example Interaction

### Input:
*"What's driving my MOIC calculation?"*

### Output:
```
🎯 Understanding your question
"You want to understand the components and drivers of your Multiple of Invested Capital calculation."

🔍 Walking through the analysis...

Step 1: Locating MOIC calculation
Looking at: FCF!B23
Found: Formula =B21/B19 showing 2.8x
Why this matters: MOIC divides exit value by initial investment

Step 2: Examining exit value components  
Looking at: FCF!B21
Found: $28M exit value from EBITDA multiple approach
Why this matters: Higher exit values directly increase MOIC

Step 3: Analyzing initial investment
Looking at: FCF!B19  
Found: $10M initial equity investment
Why this matters: Lower investment amounts increase MOIC for same returns

📊 Key Metrics
MOIC: 2.8x (Strong) @ FCF!B23
Exit Value: $28M @ FCF!B21
Initial Investment: $10M @ FCF!B19

✅ Answer
Your MOIC of 2.8x is driven primarily by...

🎯 Recommendations
• High Priority: Consider sensitivity analysis on exit multiples
• Medium Priority: Explore debt financing to boost returns
