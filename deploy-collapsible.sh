# Commit the collapsible feature
git commit -m "Add collapsible Deal Assumptions section with smooth animations

âœ¨ New Collapsible Feature:
- Added minimize/expand button to Deal Assumptions section
- Smooth CSS transitions with max-height and opacity animations
- Chevron icon rotates 180Â° when collapsed/expanded
- Maintains visibility of AI chat when assumptions are minimized
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels for screen readers

ðŸŽ¨ Animation Details:
- 400ms max-height transition with cubic-bezier easing
- 300ms opacity fade with synchronized timing
- Icon rotation animation on state change
- Reduced padding when collapsed for cleaner appearance

ðŸ›  Technical Implementation:
- JavaScript event handling for minimize button clicks
- CSS class toggle for 'collapsed' state
- Accessibility improvements with dynamic aria-label updates
- Console logging for debugging and verification

The Deal Assumptions section can now be hidden to provide more
space for the AI chat interface while maintaining easy access
to expand when needed.
