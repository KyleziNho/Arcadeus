# Commit the margin input feature
git commit -m "Add user-specified credit margin input for floating rates

ðŸ’° Credit Margin Input:
- Added Credit Margin (%) input field for floating rate calculations
- Appears only when Floating Rate is selected
- Default value of 2.0% with industry standard guidance
- Placeholder suggests 2.0% as typical margin

ðŸŽ¯ Industry Standard Guidance:
- Helper text: 'Industry standard is typically 2% - 3% for most deals'
- Default 2% margin maintains existing behavior
- Users can adjust based on deal specifics and credit profile

ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:
- Shows/hides margin input based on rate type selection
- Updates real-time preview calculations with user margin
- Integrates with Excel generation using specified margin
- Added to input change listeners for live updates

ðŸ“Š Rate Calculation Updates:
- Fixed Rate: Uses user-specified fixed rate directly
- Floating Rate: Base Rate + User-specified Margin
- All-in Rate = Base Rate + Credit Margin (user input)
- Calculations update automatically when margin changes

âœ¨ UI/UX Improvements:
- Clean conditional display logic
- Updated radio button label to 'Floating Rate (Base + Margin)'
- Professional helper text with industry context
- Seamless integration with existing debt model interface

This gives users full control over credit margin assumptions
while providing industry-standard guidance for reference.
