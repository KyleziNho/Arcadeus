git commit -m "Apple-inspired UI refinements for input fields and collapsed sections

üé® Input Field Fixes:
- Fixed text input overflow by using calc(100% - 2px) width
- Added proper box-sizing: border-box for consistent sizing
- Prevents inputs from overflowing container margins
- Follows Apple's precise spacing guidelines

‚ú® Collapsed Section Improvements:
- Reduced collapsed section padding for cleaner appearance
- Improved vertical centering of 'Deal Assumptions' text when minimized
- Enhanced h3 styling with proper flex alignment in collapsed state
- Eliminated excess whitespace in minimized view

üîß Minimize Button Refinements:
- Reduced button size to 24x24px for more subtle appearance
- Added Apple-style subtle shadow (0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05))
- Improved icon typography with SF Pro Display font family
- Adjusted font-weight to 500 for better readability
- Smaller 16px font-size to match refined button size

üìê Form Spacing Enhancements:
- Added margin-bottom: 0 to last form-group for cleaner edges
- Improved overall visual hierarchy and spacing consistency
- Following Apple Human Interface Guidelines for form layouts

These changes create a more polished, Apple-like interface with
proper spacing, refined typography, and precise element sizing.
