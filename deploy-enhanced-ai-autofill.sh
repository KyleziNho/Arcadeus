🔧 CRITICAL FIX: AI Auto-Fill Not Working

📊 Enhanced AI Data Extraction:
- Increased token limit from 1500 to 4000 for comprehensive analysis
- Extended CSV content processing from 10KB to 50KB
- Added structured content formatting for better AI understanding
- Improved file content preview with full data visibility
- Enhanced prompt engineering for financial data recognition

🤖 AI Service Improvements:
- Added dedicated auto-fill mode with specialized prompts
- Comprehensive extraction instructions for all form fields
- Lower temperature (0.3) for more accurate data extraction
- Structured JSON response format enforcement
- Better error handling for parsing failures

📁 File Processing Enhancements:
- Increased file content analysis window 5x (10KB → 50KB)
- Added structured CSV content formatting
- Full content analysis for financial data extraction
- Line-by-line preview with complete data visibility
- Improved file type detection and handling

🎯 Data Extraction Prompts:
- Detailed field mapping for all sections
- Context clues for revenue/cost terminology
- Growth rate detection (YoY%, CAGR, projections)
- Deal value recognition (EV, purchase price, etc.)
- Currency symbol and format detection

📈 Form Population Improvements:
- Enhanced applyExtractedData function
- Added debt model parameter extraction
- Improved null value handling
- Real-time progress indicators
- Detailed success/error messaging

⚡ User Experience Enhancements:
- Step-by-step processing feedback
- 'Reading files...' → 'Extracting content...' → 'AI analyzing...'
- Clear success summaries showing populated sections
- Improved error messages for troubleshooting
- Button state management during processing

🧠 AI Intelligence Upgrades:
- Comprehensive financial terminology recognition
- Multiple synonym detection (revenue/sales/income)
- Flexible date format parsing
- Percentage and currency value extraction
- Growth pattern identification

🛡️ Error Handling Improvements:
- Graceful fallback for AI parsing failures
- Better timeout management
- Detailed console logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms

🎯 Problem Resolution:
- AI now properly reads uploaded file content
- Understands which inputs to fill based on context
- Intelligently maps extracted data to form fields
- Handles various document formats and structures
- Successfully populates all sections as requested

This fix ensures the AI auto-fill feature actually works by:
1. Sending more file content to the AI (50KB vs 10KB)
2. Using specialized prompts for financial data extraction
3. Increasing token limits for comprehensive analysis
4. Adding proper progress feedback during processing
5. Implementing robust data mapping to form fields

The system now successfully extracts and populates:
- Currency and date parameters
- Deal assumptions and values
- Revenue items with growth rates
- Cost items with escalation
- Exit assumptions
- Debt model parameters
