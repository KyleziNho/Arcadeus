# Commit the new worksheet feature
git commit -m "Create debt schedule in new worksheet with proper formatting

ðŸ“Š New Worksheet Creation:
- Creates new 'Debt Schedule' worksheet instead of modifying current sheet
- Deletes existing 'Debt Schedule' worksheet if it exists before creating new one
- Activates the new worksheet automatically for immediate viewing
- Protects user's current worksheet from being modified

ðŸŽ¯ Transposed Layout (like provided image):
- Period headers across columns (monthly periods: 1-Jan-25, 2-Feb-25, etc.)
- Base interest rate and All-in interest rate as rows
- Proper date formatting with month abbreviations and 2-digit years
- Row labels in first column for easy identification

ðŸŽ¨ Professional Formatting:
- Gray header row with 'Debt Model' title and merged cells
- Green background for period header row
- Bold formatting for all headers and row labels
- Complete table borders for clean appearance
- Auto-fitted columns for optimal display

ðŸ“… Dynamic Period Generation:
- Creates monthly periods based on holding period input
- Caps at 60 months maximum for reasonable display
- Generates proper date sequence starting from current date
- Prepares foundation for future daily/monthly frequency options

This ensures users can generate debt schedules without affecting
their current worksheet while maintaining professional formatting.
