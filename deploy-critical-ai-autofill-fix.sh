🚨 URGENT BUG FIX: Resolved 'Limited Data Extracted' Error

🔧 Fixed Root Cause Issues:
1. Removed broken chat functionality causing 'Chat messages div not found' errors
2. Updated AI prompt to include exact JSON structure required by backend
3. Fixed data extraction flow to properly parse CSV financial data

📊 AI Prompt Engineering Fix:
- Added explicit JSON structure example with 'extractedData' wrapper
- Specified exact format that chat.js API expects
- Included comprehensive data extraction rules
- Enhanced parsing instructions for CSV format

🛠️ Code Fixes Applied:
- Simplified addChatMessage() to avoid DOM errors
- Removed initialization chat messages causing console errors
- Updated createDataExtractionPrompt() with proper JSON format
- Aligned frontend prompt with backend API expectations

📁 CSV Processing Improvements:
- AI now receives proper JSON structure template
- Clear instructions for extracting real financial data
- Percentage conversion rules (75% → 75)
- Date formatting requirements (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Currency detection from symbols and codes

🎯 Expected Results:
- CSV files like 'Sample Company Ltd.' now properly extracted
- No more 'Limited Data Extracted' warnings
- All form sections populated with real data
- Console errors eliminated

💡 User Impact:
- AI auto-fill now works with uploaded CSV files
- Financial data properly mapped to form fields
- No more failed extractions from valid documents
- Clean console without DOM-related errors

This fix resolves the critical issue where the AI auto-fill feature
was showing 'Limited Data Extracted' even with valid CSV files
containing complete financial data.
