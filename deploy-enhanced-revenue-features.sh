git commit -m "Enhance Revenue Items with period-linked non-linear growth and click-to-expand

üìà Smart Period-Linked Non-Linear Growth:
- Links non-linear growth to High-Level Parameters period selection
- Uses actual calculated holding periods from project dates
- Adapts to selected period type (daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Dynamic period labeling based on user selection

üéØ Intelligent Growth Input System:
- ‚â§12 periods: Individual period-by-period growth input fields
- >12 periods: Grouped period ranges with add/remove functionality
- Smart suggestions for period ranges (e.g., Months 1-12, then 13-24)
- Automatic period calculations from High-Level Parameters

üìä Advanced Period Grouping (>12 periods):
- Group 1: Default periods 1-12 with customizable growth rate
- Add Group: Creates new range starting from last period + 1
- Remove Groups: Dynamic group management with smart re-indexing
- Example: Months 1-12 at 1%, Months 13-36 at 0.5%

üñ±Ô∏è Click-to-Expand Minimized Sections:
- Click anywhere on collapsed section to expand it
- Prevents expansion when clicking minimize button
- Smooth cursor change indicators (pointer for collapsed, default for expanded)
- Works for all sections: High-Level Parameters, Deal Assumptions, Revenue Items, Debt Model

üé® Professional Period Group UI:
- Clean bordered containers for each period group
- Grid layout for From/To/Growth Rate inputs
- Green '+ Add Group' and red '√ó Remove' buttons
- Smart button management (add button moves to last group)
- Consistent styling with existing section design

üîß Technical Integration:
- Real-time period calculation extraction from High-Level Parameters
- Dynamic DOM manipulation for period group management
- Event delegation for scalable functionality
- Automatic period labeling (Day/Month/Quarter/Year)
- Smart default value suggestions for new groups

‚ö° Enhanced User Experience:
- Contextual help text with period-specific examples
- Intuitive grouped input for complex growth scenarios
- Visual feedback with cursor changes for collapsed sections
- Professional color coding (green for add, red for remove)

üßÆ Financial Modeling Power:
- Supports complex multi-phase growth scenarios
- Period-accurate modeling based on actual project timeline
- Flexible grouping for sophisticated financial projections
- Ready for Excel generation with detailed growth data

This creates a comprehensive revenue modeling system that adapts
to user parameters and provides professional-grade flexibility.
