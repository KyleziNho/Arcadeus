ðŸŽ¨ Radio Button Modern Selection:
- Removed blue sidebar indicators inside buttons
- Full button background turns blue when selected
- White text on blue background for better contrast
- White circular indicator instead of blue
- Clean, modern card-style selection

âœ¨ Checkbox Modern Selection:
- Removed blue sidebar indicators inside buttons
- Full button background turns blue when selected
- White text on blue background for selected state
- White square indicator instead of blue
- Consistent with radio button styling

ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:
- Uses :has() pseudo-selector for parent container styling
- Blue background with white text for selected state
- White indicators with subtle shadows for contrast
- Maintains all hover animations and effects
- Enhanced box-shadow for selected state depth

ðŸŽ¯ User Experience:
- Clear visual feedback with full button highlighting
- Better contrast and readability when selected
- More modern and cohesive design language
- Consistent selection pattern across all form elements

The interface now uses modern full-button highlighting
instead of small sidebar indicators for better UX.
