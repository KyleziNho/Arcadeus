ðŸ“Š DEAL ASSUMPTIONS EXTRACTION: Expand AI auto-fill functionality

ðŸŽ¯ New Extraction Capabilities:
- Deal Name: Extract target company name from document headers
- Deal Value: Calculate from Equity + Debt or find total transaction value  
- Transaction Fee: Extract banking/advisory fees or default to 2.5%
- Deal LTV: Extract leverage ratio or calculate from debt/equity breakdown

ðŸ’° Financial Data Processing:
- Calculate deal value: Equity Contribution + Debt Financing
- Extract LTV from 'Acquisition LTV,75%' or calculate from ratios
- Process transaction fees from percentage format
- Extract company names from document headers and deal descriptions

ðŸ”§ Enhanced AI Prompt:
- Clear extraction rules for both high-level parameters and deal assumptions
- Specific calculation logic for deal value and LTV
- Fallback defaults for missing transaction fees (2.5%)
- Company name extraction from multiple sources

ðŸ“‹ Expected Results from Your CSV:
HIGH-LEVEL PARAMETERS:
- Currency: USD
- Start Date: 2025-03-31  
- End Date: 2030-03-31
- Model Periods: monthly

DEAL ASSUMPTIONS:
- Deal Name: Sample Company Ltd.
- Deal Value: 100,000,000 (25M equity + 75M debt)
- Transaction Fee: 1.5% (from 'Transaction Fees,1.50%')
- Deal LTV: 75% (from 'Acquisition LTV,75%')

âœ¨ Enhanced User Experience:
- Detailed console logging for each section application
- Comprehensive success summary showing extracted data
- Clear section-by-section processing feedback
- Both sections populate simultaneously from single file upload

ðŸ§ª Complete Testing Flow:
1. Upload CSV file with financial data
2. Click 'Auto Fill with AI'
3. Watch console for detailed extraction logs
4. Verify both High-Level Parameters AND Deal Assumptions sections populate
5. Check success summary showing all extracted values

This expansion provides intelligent extraction of key deal parameters
while maintaining the reliable high-level parameters functionality.
